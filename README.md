### Features
- **Generate a unique Peer ID:** When you open the page, a unique Peer ID is generated for you.
- **Connect to another Peer:** Users can connect to each other using a Peer ID.
- **Send/Receive messages:** Once connected, you can send and receive messages with the connected peer in real-time.

### How to Use
1. Open the application link: [PeerJS Chat Demo](https://jaykkumar01.github.io/peer-project-public/).
2. A Peer ID will be automatically generated and displayed for you.
3. Share your Peer ID with someone else or enter their Peer ID to connect.
4. Once the connection is established, send and receive messages.

### Technical Details
- This project uses the **PeerJS** library to establish peer-to-peer connections.
